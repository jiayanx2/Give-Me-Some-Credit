This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
setwd("/Users/yynpy/Desktop/resources/job/川谷/credit")
sampleEntry <- read.csv("sampleEntry.csv", header = TRUE)
cs_training <- read.csv("cs-training.csv", header = TRUE)
cs_test <- read.csv("cs-test.csv", header = TRUE)
```

```{deal}
plot(cs_training['age'])
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
